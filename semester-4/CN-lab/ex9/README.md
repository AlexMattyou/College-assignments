Algorithm:
Setup:

Create nodes and establish point-to-point links between them.
Install the internet stack on the nodes.
Assign IP addresses to the network interfaces.

Distance Vector Routing Simulation:

Install and configure the DSDV routing protocol on the nodes.
Set up routing tables using the DSDV protocol.
Run the simulation.
Link State Routing Simulation:


Install and configure the OSPF routing protocol on the nodes.
Add OSPF interfaces to the global routing table.
Run the simulation.
