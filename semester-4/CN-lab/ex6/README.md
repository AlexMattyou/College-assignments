Algorithm:

ARP Simulation:
Create a simulated ARP table with IP addresses mapped to MAC addresses.
Define a function to simulate sending an ARP request by looking up the MAC address for a given IP address in the ARP table.
Prompt the user for the target IP address and display the corresponding MAC address.

RARP Simulation:
Create a simulated RARP table with MAC addresses mapped to IP addresses.
Define a function to simulate sending a RARP request by looking up the IP address for a given MAC address in the RARP table.
Prompt the user for the target MAC address and display the corresponding IP address.
