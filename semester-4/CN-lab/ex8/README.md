Algorithm:

Setup:

Initialize the NS-3 simulator and parse command line arguments.

Topology Creation:
Create nodes and establish point-to-point links with specified data rate and delay.

Network Configuration:
Install the internet stack on the nodes.
Assign IP addresses to the network interfaces.

Application Setup:

TCP Application:
Create a packet sink application on one node to receive TCP packets.
Create an OnOff application on another node to generate TCP traffic at a constant rate.

UDP Application:
Create a packet sink application on another node to receive UDP packets.
Create an OnOff application on a different node to generate UDP traffic at a constant rate.

Flow Monitoring:
Enable flow monitoring to capture the statistics of the TCP and UDP flows.
Analyze the collected statistics to compare the performance in terms of throughput and packet loss.

Run Simulation:
Run the simulator for a specified duration and capture the results.
Destroy the simulator instance after the run.
